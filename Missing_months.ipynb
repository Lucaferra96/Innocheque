    "# Missing Monthly Data Detection - Readme\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is designed to identify missing monthly raster data files within a set of specified folders. The script scans through the given folders and detects missing raster files based on a predefined naming convention. Detected missing months are recorded in text files for each folder, indicating the years and months where data is absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Environment**: Ensure that you have a working Python environment with the required packages installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**: Navigate to the directory where the script is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by running the Python command: `python script_name.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Script Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Packages**: The necessary `os` package is imported to handle file and folder operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parent Directory and Folders**: The parent directory containing the target folders and the list of folders themselves are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterating Over Folders**:\n",
    "   - The script iterates through each specified folder.\n",
    "   - The starting year is determined based on the folder's content type.\n",
    "   - A list named `missing_months` is initialized to store detected missing months.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Missing Month Detection**:\n",
    "   - The script iterates through the years from the starting year to 2019 (inclusive).\n",
    "   - For each year, it further iterates through the months from 1 to 12.\n",
    "   - The expected file name is generated based on the predefined naming convention.\n",
    "   - The script checks if the generated file path exists.\n",
    "   - If the file path does not exist, the year and month are added to the `missing_months` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Save Missing Months to Text File**:\n",
    "   - The script creates a text file with a name indicating the folder and \"missing_months\".\n",
    "   - It writes the detected missing months in a structured format, showing the year and month.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Completion Message**:\n",
    "   - The script prints a message indicating the completion of the missing month detection process for the current folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customize the `parent_directory` and `folders` variables to match your directory structure and folder names.\n",
    "- Verify the naming convention used to generate file names based on the folder's content type.\n",
    "- Adapt the script if your dataset's naming conventions or directory structure differ.\n",
    "- The script assumes that the data is missing if the expected file does not exist. Verify this assumption based on your dataset.\n",
