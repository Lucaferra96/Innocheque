    "# Chelsa_V2_Monthly Data Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook script that focuses on resampling raster data using ArcPy, a Python library for geospatial data analysis. The script takes raster data representing various climate variables and resamples them from a 1 km to a 250 m resolution using the bilinear resampling method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the script, ensure you have the following installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ArcGIS Desktop with ArcPy (version compatible with the script)\n",
    "- Required raster data files in the specified directories\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your ArcGIS environment.\n",
    "2. Modify the paths and parameters in the code to match your data and requirements.\n",
    "3. Run the script cells sequentially to perform the resampling steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Script Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The script performs the following main tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Import Packages and Set Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessary Python packages are imported, and the ArcGIS environment is set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The script iterates through specified folders containing raster data files and performs a resampling operation on each raster file. The output is saved in new output folders, maintaining the original file structure and geographical information. The bilinear resampling method is used for resampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure that the ArcGIS environment is set up correctly before running the script.\n",
    "- Modify input and output paths as needed.\n",
    "- Adjust the cell size, resampling method, and other parameters during raster resampling to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
